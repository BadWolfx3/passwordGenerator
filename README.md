9/27/2020
Kelsey Busser

## Description

Goal was to create a password generator that generates one randomly password based on user-selected criteria. 
It runs in a browser and is responsive. When clicking on “Generate Password” the user should see a prompt pop up. 
It will then ask them how many characters they want. After it will ask if they want numbers in it, symbols, upper case letters, and lower case letters.
At the end a random password will display in the box.
